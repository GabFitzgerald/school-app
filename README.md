This is an exercise undertaken while learning Ruby on Rails frame work at Coder Academy.

Create an app to track Students and the Courses they are enrolled in.
- Students should have a first name, last name and date of birth. A Student can be enrolled in many Courses.
- Courses should have a title, room number and teacher name. A Course can have many students enrolled.
- The joining table should have a grade field so that we can record the grade for a Student in a given Course.
